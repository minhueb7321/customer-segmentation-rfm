# Customer Segmentation for E-commerce Platform - RFM Analysis

## Description
This Power BI project analyzes customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) methodology. RFM helps businesses understand customer behavior and tailor marketing efforts effectively by focusing on three key metrics:

1. **Recency (R)**  
   - *What it measures*: How recently a customer made a purchase or interacted with the business.  
   - *Why it's important*: Recent customers are more likely to respond to promotions or offers.

2. **Frequency (F)**  
   - *What it measures*: How often a customer makes a purchase or interacts with the business.  
   - *Why it's important*: Frequent customers are more loyal and ideal for upselling or retention campaigns.

3. **Monetary Value (M)**  
   - *What it measures*: How much money a customer spends within a given period.  
   - *Why it's important*: Higher spenders are more profitable and should be targeted with personalized offers.
